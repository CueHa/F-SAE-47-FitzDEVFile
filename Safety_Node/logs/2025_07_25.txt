## Summary of what was done:
-- Done with the induction on the soldering station. Now I can use it whenever I need to.
-- Done with the proto-board with the ESP32, the OLED, the ASSI LEDs, the 8 inputs(all in pullup), 2 outputs, one VCC and two GND inputs.
-- Done with modding the USB to UB micro cable to cut the VCC line, so I can power the ESP32 with the VCC and GND in the proto-board.

## Tangents/Unrelated work:
-- None.

## State of system when stopped:
-- Proto-board is done with all the cnnections. 
-- Everythign works as expected for the proto-board except the output; throttle and EBS remains untested.

## Questions/unknowns:
-- How can we work around the issue of the ESP32 being only able to operate at 3.3V logic levels?

## Next step when resuming:
-- continue with the hardware connections.

-- test the outputs for throttle and EBS.
-- solve the issue with the ESP32 being only able to operate at 3.3V logic levels.
-- create the buck converter to lower down fused 24V to 5V for the proto-board and relays.
