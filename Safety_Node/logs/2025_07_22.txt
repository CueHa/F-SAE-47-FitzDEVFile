## Summary of what was done:
-- Decided to get inducted on Soldering station of FSAE47 electrical team. 
-- Decided to go for a quick way to make the node mountable on the prototype go-kart.
-- No longer need to order a level shifter as I decided to just cut the VCC line of the USB to UB micro that connects the ESP32 to the computer. This way, I can power the ESP32 safety from the 24V LV battery of the go-kart instead of overloading the Jetson.

## Tangents/Unrelated work:
-- None.

## State of system when stopped:
-- All code and phases are done. What's left is actual hardware connecting.
-- Start to think if PCB is needed for this implementation.

## Questions/unknowns:
-- 

## Next step when resuming:
-- continue with the hardware connections.
-- Get a proto-board to make the whole thing mountable. This is less time consumed that creating a PCB. Look into have clamps for servicability.
